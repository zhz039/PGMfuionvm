**Overview**<br />
"PGMfuionvm" is a MATLAB-based implementation of the methodologies described in the research paper "Graph-learning Approach to Combine Multiresolution Seismic Velocity Models". This project aims to combine multiresolution seismic velocity maps with physics-informed probability graphical models (PIPGMs) for enhanced accuracy in seismic velocity models.

**Installation**<br />
Runing with MATLAB2022a with Image Processing Toolbox and GCO-V3.0.

**Usage**<br />
Provide examples of how to utilize this tool for multi-resolution seismic velocity model fusion. Run Mian.m to start.

**Research Paper**<br />
For a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and principles underlying this implementation, refer to the paper available at ESS Open Archive.
