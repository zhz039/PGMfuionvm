**Overview**<br />
"PGMfuionvm" is a MATLAB-based implementation of the methodologies described in the research paper "3D Multiresolution Velocity Model Fusion With Probability Graphical Models" This project aims to fuse multiresolution seismic tomography maps with probability graphical models (PGMs) for enhanced accuracy in seismic velocity models.

**Installation**<br />
Runing with MATLAB2022a with Image Processing Toolbox and GCO-V3.0.

**Usage**<br />
Provide examples of how to utilize this tool for multi-resolution seismic velocity model fusion. Run Mian.m to start.

**Research Paper**<br />
For a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and principles underlying this implementation, refer to the paper available at ESS Open Archive.
