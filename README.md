**Overview**<br />
"PGMfuionvm" is a MATLAB-based implementation of the methodologies described in the research paper "Fusion of Multiresolution Seismic Tomography Maps Using Physics-informed Probability Graphical Models." This project aims to fuse multiresolution seismic tomography maps with probability graphical models (PGMs) for enhanced accuracy in seismic velocity models.

**Installation**<br />
Runing with MATLAB2022a with Image Processing Toolbox.

**Usage**<br />
Provide examples and guidelines on how to utilize this tool for seismic tomography analysis. Run Mian.m to start.

**Research Paper**<br />
